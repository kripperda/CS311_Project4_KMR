Two versions for all pages contained in the folder: HTML and CSS

HTML development was confusing with the tables at first.
        Eventually figured it out and got the table layout to fit.
        Realized that the Menu bar does not move as easily as with <CSS>
        

CSS development required some additional research. 
        Found a layout style that would work for flexbox with the layout I was seeking
        There are a bunch more layout options that assist with CSS
        Thoroughly enjoyed playing with these features and making the pieces line up properly.
        The more features added, the easier the layout becomes. 
        Adding colors and adjusting the wording to different styles and refreshing helped me learn a lot. 
        Flexbox was considerably easier than grid for me for some reason. 

Reviewed the Bootstrap framework thoroughly and tried to implement
        Never fully materialized and became more confusing the more I fiddled with it.
Reviewed the Foundations framework and tried to implement
        Liked the simplicity of everything contained within. 
        Hard to search for functions to utilize. 
            Assume that comes with familiarity
        Will definitely utilize in future projects.
